# Sloth
## An SMT Solver for String Constraints

Sloth is a decision procedure for several relevant
fragments of string constraints, including the straight-line fragment,
which is sufficiently expressive for many applications from verification or
security. Sloth uses succinct alternating finite-state automata
(AFAs) as concise symbolic representations of string constraints, and
uses model checking algorithms like IC3 for solving emptiness of
the AFA.
